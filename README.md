# PowerBI-Project - CarDekho-Used-Cars-Analysis

📌 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end data analytics case study built using a real-world used car dataset inspired by CarDekho listings.

The objective is simple and practical: Understand pricing, performance, usage patterns, and market behavior in the used car ecosystem.

# 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Power BI – Data modeling, DAX, dashboarding 

SQL – Table creation & data understanding

Excel / CSV – Raw dataset handling

DAX Measures – KPIs, averages, comparisons

# Key Business Questions Answered

- Which car models dominate the used car market?

- What brands command the highest selling prices?

- How do mileage, power, and engine capacity trade off?

- Which fuel types show higher vehicle usage?

- How do manual vs automatic cars differ in performance?

- Who sells more cars — dealers or individuals?
If your dashboard can’t answer questions like these, it’s useless. This one does.

# 📂 Dataset

Used car listings with attributes like:

Brand & Model

Selling Price

Mileage

Engine Capacity

Power (BHP)

Fuel Type

Transmission

Seller Type

Kilometers Driven

Dataset cleaned and modeled for analytics, not just visuals.

# 🔍 Key Insights 

Manual cars dominate volume, but automatics show higher power variance.

Luxury brands (Ferrari, Rolls-Royce, Bentley) skew average price heavily.

LPG and Diesel cars tend to have higher average KM driven, indicating usage intensity.

Mileage and power show an inverse relationship beyond a threshold — no free lunch.

# 🚀 Why This Project Is Strong

Let’s be honest:

This is not a tutorial copy

This is not a Kaggle medal chase

This does simulate real analyst work

You’ll see:

Clear metric selection

Logical dashboard segregation

Business-first storytelling

Clean visual hierarchy

# 🤝 Open for Feedback & Collaboration

I actively invite critique.

If you think:

A metric is misleading

A visual can be improved

A business angle is missing

👉 Open an Issue
👉 Fork and suggest enhancements
👉 Or connect with me directly

That’s how real analysts grow.

# 📌 Future Enhancements

Predictive price modeling

Segmentation by city / region

Time-based trend analysis

Feature importance using ML
